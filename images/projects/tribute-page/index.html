<ul>
<li><b>1914</b> - born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in Vienna, Austria-Hungary</li>
<li><b>1920s</b> - discovered by producer Max Reinhardt and brought to Berlin, and begins her training in the theatre before returning to Vienna to begin working in the film industry</li>
<li><b>1933</b> - at age 18, stars in the notoriously racy film Ecstasy before marrying Friedrich Mandl, a wealthy arms dealer, a controlling man who objected to her film career and kept her a virtual prisoner in his castle</li>
<li><b>1937</b> - flees her husband and ends up in Paris where she meets film producer and co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios. Mayer persuades her to change her name to Hedy Lamarr</li>
<li><b>1938</b> - arrives in Hollywood where Mayer promotes her as the “world’s most beautiful woman”</li>
<li><b>1940</b> - World War II has broken out. Lamarr meets avant garde composer George Antheil at a dinner party and they go on to form a business partnership. Keen to help the war effort, they work on an idea Lamarr had for a frequency hopping “Secret Communications System” that could guide torpedoes to their target without being intercepted by the enemy</li>
<li><b>1941</b> -  Lamarr and Antheil submit their proposal for patenting</li>
<li><b>1942</b> - Lamarr and Antheil are granted a patent. Rather than developing the Secret Communications System commercially, they gave it to the government to help in the war effort – although the technology of the day was not advanced enough to make use of the System (and the US Navy refused to take the System seriously). It was never used during World War II</li>
<li><b>1957</b> - the patent was not forgotten. The Sylvania Electronic Systems Division redeveloped the idea for the System incorporating a transistor and improving on the original design with a spread-spectrum system</li>
<li><b>1962</b> - The redesigned system was finally taken up by the US Navy and fitted to ships to enable secure communications during the Cuban Missile Crisis</li>
<li><b>1980s</b> - the US military declassifies the spread-spectrum technology and the private sector begins to develop the system for consumer electronics, which became a core element in mobile phones and fax machines</li>
<li><b>1997</b> -  after decades without recognition of her invention, Lamarr and Antheil were finally awarded the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EEF) Pioneer Award. And in the same year, Lamarr was the first woman to be awarded the Invention Convention®’s BULBIE™ Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award (the Oscar® of inventing)</li>
<li><b>2000</b> - Hedy Lamarr dies aged 85</li>
<li><b>2014</b> -  Lamarr is given an honorary grave in Vienna’s Central Cemetery</li>

If she is remembered at all, Hedy Lamarr is remembered as a Hollywood icon who starred alongside such greats as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Judy Garland. Yet she was a woman ahead of her time, and her pioneering idea for the Secret Communications System is still very much with us today in mobile phone, email, GPS, Wifi and Bluetooth technology.</p>
